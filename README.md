<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

The goal of this classroom is to provide you with necessary mathematical background knowledge help you start your journey into the world of digital technology.  

<h3 id="audience">Who is this repository for?</h3>

The topics and techniques demonstrated in this classroom are primarily oriented towards learners wanting to learn Mathematical concepts used in the field of Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Data Science and NLP.

<h2 id="codealong">How to use this repository?</h2>

The Classroom is aimed at providing blended and experiential learning and is written to facilitate learning by doing. You will find the notebooks with embedded videos on the sub-topics, hands-on exercises and documentation on the topics all in one place. The videos are time-stamped so you can skip the parts that you are already familiar with.

You can run the classroom content in two ways:

<h3 id="binder"><strong>Option 1:</strong> use Binder</h3>

If you want to experiment with the code in a live environment you can also use `binder`.  

Binder allows to create a live environment where you can execute code just as if you were on your computer based on a GitHub repository, it is very awesome!  

Click on the button below to launch binder:

 <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/yogeshmpandey/M4DT/master?urlpath=lab"><img src="https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg"></a>

**Note: you could use binder to complete the exercises but it will not save!!**

<h3 id="clonerepo"><strong>Option 2:</strong> Set up local Python setup</h3>

You can essentially "download" the contents of this repository by cloning the repository or by clicking "Clone or download" button and then "Download ZIP":

After you download and extracted the zip file into a folder you can follow the [steps](#setup) to set up your local environment:

<h4 id="setup">Running the Classroom Locally</h2>

### 1. Operating System

These labs have been validated on Windows-10. But you can use them in any environment.

### 2. Software installation steps

* Python3-pip
* Jupyter

### 3. Run the Jupyter Notebook

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook

```bash
$ py -m notebook
```

2. It opens in the default browser, locate the required Jupyter notebook (m4dt.ipynb) file and double click on it to open and run.

<h2 id="questions">Questions?</h2>

If you have questions or experience problems please use the `issues` tab of this repository.
