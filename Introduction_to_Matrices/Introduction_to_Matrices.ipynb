    "In our last exercise, we explored vectors. In this exercises we will continue by representing vectors as matrices. A matrix is an array of numbers that can be arranged into rows and columns. A matrix is denoted as $A(mXn)$, the m rows are horizontal and the n columns are vertical. The individual items in an m√ón matrix A, often denoted by a(i,j) where i and j usually vary from 1 to m and n are called its elements or entries. Lets watch the video below to understand Matrices and Matrices operations in detial. "

    "In Matrix multiplication there are two cases to consider. Scaler multiplication and Matrix multiplication. Scaler multiplication is multiplying a matrix by a single number, and Matrix multiplication is multiplying a matrix by another matrix. Scalar multiplication is fairly straightforward. You just multiply each element of the matrix by the scalar multiplier. Dot product multiplication requires two matrices in which the number of rows in the first matrix is the same as the number of columns in the second matrix."
